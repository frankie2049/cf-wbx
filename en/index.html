        <p><b>What is a Winbox Shareholder?</b> Holding a Winbox shareholder agent account offers more advantages and benefits! Agents will receive rebates from all players registered under them according to the "rebate list". The system will automatically transfer the rewards to Winbox shareholders/agents on time every day. Shareholders are linked to company profits and are responsible for their own earnings.
            <br><br><b>What is a Winbox Cash Player?</b> When you hold a Winbox shareholder account, the player accounts directly opened under your shareholder name are cash players (Cash Players). Through the promotional activities of the cash player accounts, you can develop new downline players and earn additional commissions, which only cover water fees and are not tied to company profits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>1. Profit Commission Sharing</h2><br>
            <p>Your profit is divided into two parts: [Shareholder Agent Share] + [Cash Player Share].</p>
            <h3>a. Shareholder Share (Bucket)</h3>
            When your downline players generate a turnover (bet amount) of RM100,000 within 24 hours (from 12 PM to 12 PM the next day), the company's turnover is RM130,000,000, the company's profit is RM3,150,000, and the shareholder shares are 130. Assuming your share is 70, the reward distribution is calculated as follows:<br>
            <br> 100,000 / 130,000,000 * 3,150,000 / 130 * 70 = RM1,437
            The shareholder receives: 0.2% of the turnover = RM1,437, which means you earn RM1,437 for that day.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Cash Player Share (Turnover Commission)</h3>
        The daily Commission is calculated based on the total turnover amount from 12:00 PM - 11:59 AM. For example, if the total bet amount turnover for the game EKOR [rebate is 0.5%] is RM100,000, the commission is RM100,000 x 0.5% = RM500.
        The Commission will be settled at 12 PM daily and automatically issued to the gift code wallet by the system before 7 PM.
        <br>
        <h3>c. Total Commission</h3>In summary, RM1,437 + RM500 = RM1,937, your total commission for the day is RM1,937.
